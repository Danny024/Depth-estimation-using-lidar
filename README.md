# Depth-estimation-using-lidar
This projects provides a solution using a generated simulated lidar histogram to estimate the depth image using a simple matched filter algorithm and display the results.

## Data Description
The Lidar System provides a 3-D cube of data where two dimensions are related to pixels and the third is related to time-of-flight or range.
